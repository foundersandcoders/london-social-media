# London Social Media


## What 

A place to coordinate and manage social media posts and plan upcoming email blasts etc.

## Why 

To increase awareness of founders & coders 

## How

Throughout the week, we were responsible in taking photos and videos of highlights of the week.

Here are a few examples:

- Speakers giving presentations at FAC.

- Students presenting projects 

- Friday's Stop Go Continue

- General photos of students coding at FAC

- Fun activities

## The process:

1. Upload photo's and video's to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-bY1dUd8QjecWUxOHlyaWtpaVE/view)

2. Create a new issue in this [repository](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-social-media/issues)

**Make sure to add the url of the photos/videos from the google drive, and to add captions to each photo/video when they are posted on social media**

Here is an example of the format we used when submitting issues: 
[Example issue](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-social-media/issues/14)

3. Assign the point person as a reviewer in the issue 

4. Submit the issue and contact the point person (using gitter) and let them know you have added new photos/videos.



Pros

- Capturing memories to look back on


Cons 

- A lot of time was wasted during business development time (approx 2hrs). Lot's of time not doing anything productive

- Lack of autonomy to upload photos + videos ourselves




How we could have improved:

1. Use a professional camera (DSLR) for better quality photos and videos
2. 


What we would change: 

- The ability to post photos and videos directly to the social media platforms

- Lack of instagram
